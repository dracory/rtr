**Objective:**

Update the main `README.md` file for the `dracory/rtr` project to be a comprehensive, professional, and accurate overview.

**Mandatory Instructions:**

You must follow these steps sequentially. Do not skip any step. Confirm the completion of each step before proceeding to the next.

**STEP 1: Code Analysis**

*   **Action:** Thoroughly analyze the Go source code (`.go` files) to gain a complete understanding of the current implementation, public APIs, and all functionalities.
*   **Purpose:** This is the most critical step to ensure the `README.md` is accurate and reflects the latest state of the code, as existing documentation may be outdated.
*   **Confirmation:** State "STEP 1 COMPLETE" when you have finished this analysis.

**STEP 2: Documentation Review**

*   **Action:** Review the entire `docs/` directory, including all subdirectories, and the `GEMINI.md` file.
*   **Purpose:** To gather all existing information about the project's features, architecture, usage patterns, and best practices.
*   **Confirmation:** State "STEP 2 COMPLETE" when you have finished this review.

**STEP 3: README Structure and Content**

*   **Action:** Create the `README.md` using the following structure.
*   **Purpose:** To provide a clear, organized, and user-friendly entry point to the project.

    *   **Project Overview:** A brief introduction to the `dracory/rtr` router.
    *   **Core Features:** A bulleted list of the most important features.
    *   **Installation:** How to install the package.
    *   **Quick Start:** A simple "Hello, World!" example.
    *   **Key Concepts:** Briefly explain:
        *   Routing (basic, parameters, groups)
        *   Middleware (before/after)
        *   Domain-Based Routing
        *   Declarative Configuration
    *   **Usage Examples:** Concise code snippets for common use cases.
    *   **Documentation:** Link to more detailed documentation in the `docs/` directory.
    *   **Contributing:** A brief section on how to contribute.
    *   **License:** Mention the license.

*   **Confirmation:** State "STEP 3 COMPLETE" when you have structured the README.

**STEP 4: Modularity and Conciseness (Key Requirement)**

*   **Action:**
    1.  Keep the `README.md` concise and easy to read.
    2.  **If any section becomes too long, move its detailed content to a new Markdown file inside the `docs/` directory.**
    3.  In the `README.md`, provide a summary of the moved section and a clear link to the new, detailed document.
*   **Purpose:** To maintain a clean and readable main README while providing access to in-depth information.
*   **Confirmation:** State "STEP 4 COMPLETE" when you have applied this principle.

**STEP 5: Final Polish**

*   **Action:**
    1.  Ensure all code examples are correct and easy to use.
    2.  Maintain a professional and welcoming tone.
*   **Purpose:** To deliver a high-quality, polished `README.md`.
*   **Confirmation:** State "STEP 5 COMPLETE" when you have finalized the README.

The final `README.md` must be a polished and effective "front door" for the project.
